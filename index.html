          First Come First Served sales period is open. <br />
          <br />

          Fans can apply again for tickets for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™
          through the First Come First Served sales period of Sales Phase (2)
          that starts on 5 July 2022 at 11:00 CEST / 12:00 (midday) Doha time
          and ends on 16 August 2022 at 11:00 CEST / 12:00 (midday) Doha time.
          <br />
          <br />

          During this sales period, tickets will be allocated on a first come,
          first served basis, and ticket purchases are processed as a real-time
          transaction, subject to availability. All successfully purchased
          tickets will be confirmed immediately to the ticket applicants. <br />
          <br />

          We advise football fans to place their application as soon as the
          sales period opens, as tickets will likely sell out quickly.
